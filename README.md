# Ritters von Rohan DKP for Helegrod in Echoes of Angmar

## Usage:
- download the [standalone release](https://github.com/MaSchm1983/lotroDKP/releases/download/v0.9.1-beta/lotroDKPsystem.exe)
- also download the actual [DKP file](https://github.com/MaSchm1983/lotroDKP/blob/main/lotro_dkp_backup.json)
- run the .exe on your local machine (.json file need to be in the same folder)
- anything else is more or less self explained ;-) 

## Function:
- add player
  - choose between main character or assign a twink to a main character
  - note: Twinks have no function in this system, it will just help to manage people since you can see if some mains play with twinks while hovering over the player names. twinks will shown as tooltip, thus if some players are in raid with other class it helps to assign the DKP and keep the overview
- award DKP. Just select all players in raid and enter the dkp, will be assigned to all selected players
- dkp history will show a net "+" and "-" DKP for each player
- spend DKP. For now its just for the helegrod setpieces (with DPS costs) and to track for storvagun and zaudru quest items. Choose the player, the item, and the DKP spend (if DKP are spend). Technically possible to add the lotro item data base here if any further usage of the app is planned
- spend histroy will show all items bought by players and the day of the raid, just for some tracking option if some things were messed up etc.
- bery shard: since we don't sell beryl shard via dkp, but we keep track on shards, so any player will get one, before next player can get a second etc. Just for a fair distribution
- remove player might be the most obvious thing :P 

## Loot rules for the "thursday and sunday wing clear raids", lead by "Die Ritters von Rohan"
For all people participating on our raids, here are the loot rules hopefully "in short". We decide to make a DKP system for the set pieces, since we will avoid that new players or players just joining one time get 1-2 set pieces and then don't show up anymore. We feel like its some kind of fair that active people get rewarded. However, we are aware that the discussions about fair loot rules are older than the history of MMORPGs itself and like differential equations first and second order, not fully solvable (nerd joke :-|). So this are our rules (we are open to critics here, but we discussed literally any case):

- Every player defines a "loot main". A loot main is the character he wanna equip. This character has nothing in common with the actual main character. We wanna address the problem, that certain classes are needed for fast and successful raids. And since helegrod set pieces are "bound on equip" and thus tradable, no one should suffer from being forced to play another class. So everyone can play what is needed while equip his favored character. 
- Every player gets 20 DKP per ID (40 DKP for drummers + courtyard, and 20 per wing). On sunday we usually use the courtyard ID, but any player gets the 40 DKP and thus also 100 DKP for a full clear. 
- If you have two chars and you participate on both raids, you will get 100 DKP for each raid since you put effort into keeping two raids alive and also putting the same amount of time into the second raid than others do. However, we are also aware this is the most controverse discussed point since this helps players with more than 1 char might accumulate DKP faster and thus equip main chars probably faster yes. But be aware this only concerns 4 set pieces which are dropping in the wings. After they have equipped their main characters they can equip their toons too yes, but they also have to respect the "Main before twink" rule. Thus, if any player has equipped a toon before another has his main fully equipped, it is not due to the DKP system, its because the god of loot hates you and nothing for your class drops. Its unfortunate, but we have no influence on that^^
- Thorog is a special raid together with friends from another Kin, thus it does not count into this DKP system, it's only for the wings. However, if one from "Ritters von Rohan" we also will add it into the system (with 0 DKP) to make sure, everyone get's at least one of the Thorog set pieces.
- Coldbear did not count into the loot system as well since we most of the time to it in smaller group to increase the chance of Iorchathol drops for our Champions :P 
- Once a boss is killed, a set piece will drop. The loot will be as follows with an example:
  - Minstrel shoulder piece drops:
    - minimum price is 100 DKP
    - We check in the DKP list how is "minstrel loot main".
    - All minstrel loot mains, who did not have the shoulders yet can bet no matter if they are playing hunter, guard or what ever in this particular raids (thus it can be, that 2 minstrels are in the raid, but both are not allowed to bet since they have assigned another char for "loot main")
    - The bet will be a "single secrete bet". That means any allows loot main send an IM to the raidleader with an amount of DKP they will bet. After anyone send, the raidleader announce the winner and the DKP the winner was willing to pay. Of the raidleader himself is allowed to bet on loot, a second officer or trusted raidlead will take the IMs.
    - Note: you cannot bet more DKP than you have including the DKP you will get for this raid (e.g. if you have 150dkp before the raid, you can bet max 250 DKP for the item 150 old DKP + 100 DKP for the current full clear). Negative DKP are not allowed, if you have no DKP, all people in the raid are allowed to bet.
    - If you are the only "allowed loot main" for this item, you get it for the minimum price if you want/need it
    - Note: The system also tracks the pieces you get. You are allowed to buy every piece one time. This should avoid that people buy it and sell it on auction house. Before this happen, other people are allowed to buy it. So once you have bought e.g. Mini shoulders for your loot main, and you sold it, you will struggle on get a second pair of shoulders. It only works if any other main has their shoulders. You are allowed to bet with twink minstrels then.
    - If no loot main want or need the shoulders, all players in the raid how play mini as a twink are allowed to bet for the shoulders (minimum amount of 100 DKP still persists)
    - If neither main minis nor twink minis in the raid want the shoulders, it is free 4 all. So now anyone can roll on the shoulders. In this case it is a pure random roll, so the winner with the highest roll get the shoulders for free (no DKP) and now you can do what ever you want with the shoulders, trade it, use it, sell it on auction house, sell it to vendor, no matters, they don't get tracked in this case. 
  - Set pieces follow a simple "loot main" before twink rule. Thus thinks can buy when no loot main need the item.
- Once main char is fully equipped (that means helmet, shoulders, boots and gloves) you can loot for any other char you have, BUT with respect to the Main > Twink rule. You just dont have any loot main anymore. 
- Beryl shards will be tracked only for distribution purposes. The raidleader collects all shards during the raid and at the end we roll ONE TIME and the shards are given to the highest rolls descending. We track the shards because only people who don't have a shard yet are allowed to roll. If anyone one has one shard, all players are allowed to roll again until everyone has two shards and so on.
- we decide to not track the questitems of storvagun and zaudru and hope our raid members are fair enough to skip the items until anybody has at least one.

# Ritters von Rohan DKP for Helegrod in Echoes of Angmar

## Usage:
- download the [standalone release](https://github.com/MaSchm1983/lotroDKP/releases/download/v0.9.1-beta/lotroDKPsystem.exe)
- also download the actual [DKP file](https://github.com/MaSchm1983/lotroDKP/blob/main/lotro_dkp_backup.json)
- run the .exe on your local machine (.json file need to be in the same folder)
- anything else is more or less self explained ;-) 

## Function:
- add player
  - choose between main character or assign a twink to a main character
  - note: Twinks have no function in this system, it will just help to manage people since you can see if some mains play with twinks while hovering over the player names. twinks will shown as tooltip, thus if some players are in raid with other class it helps to assign the DKP and keep the overview
- award DKP. Just select all players in raid and enter the dkp, will be assigned to all selected players
- dkp history will show a net "+" and "-" DKP for each player
- spend DKP. For now its just for the helegrod setpieces and storvagun quest items. Choose the player, the item, and the DKP spend
- spend histroy will show all items bought by players and the day of the raid, just for some tracking option if some things were messed up etc.
- bery shard: since we don't sell beryl shard via dkp, but we keep track on shards, so any player will get one, before next player can get a second etc. Just for a fair distribution
- remove player might be the most obvious thing :P
